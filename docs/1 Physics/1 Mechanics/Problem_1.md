# Problem 1: Projectile Motion Analysis

## Introduction
Projectile motion is a key concept in mechanics that explains how objects move through the air when launched. This study explores how the **range** (horizontal distance) of a projectile depends on the **angle of projection**.

## Governing Equation
The range \( R \) of a projectile launched with an initial velocity \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

where:
- \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity (m/s),
- \( \theta \) is the launch angle (degrees),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (m/sÂ²).

## **Graphical Representation**

Below is a **graph** showing how the projectile range varies with the launch angle for different initial velocities:

**Key Observations:**
- **Maximum Range at 45Â°**: The projectile reaches its farthest distance when launched at this angle.
- **Symmetry**: The same range is obtained for **two complementary angles** (e.g., 30Â° and 60Â°).
- **Higher Initial Velocity = Greater Range**: Increasing \( v_0 \) extends the projectile's reach.
- **Higher Gravity = Shorter Range**: If \( g \) increases (e.g., on Jupiter), the projectile doesn't travel as far.

## **Further Exploration**
To enhance realism, future improvements could include:
âœ… **Air Resistance**: Drag forces affect real-world motion.
âœ… **Uneven Terrain**: Launching from different heights changes the range.
âœ… **Different Gravity Environments**: Comparing projectile motion on the Moon vs. Earth vs. Mars.
