# Problem 1

## Introduction
Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in mechanics. In this problem, we analyze how the **range** of a projectile depends on the **angle of projection**. 

## Governing Equation
The range \( R \) of a projectile launched with an initial velocity \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \) (with respect to the horizontal) is given by:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

where:
- \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity (m/s),
- \( \theta \) is the launch angle (degrees),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (m/sÂ²).

## **Python Implementation**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def projectile_range(v0, theta, g=9.81):
    """
    Computes the range of a projectile given initial velocity and launch angle.
    :param v0: Initial velocity (m/s)
    :param theta: Launch angle (degrees)
    :param g: Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2), default is Earth's gravity
    :return: Range of the projectile (meters)
    """
    theta_rad = np.radians(theta)  # Convert angle to radians
    return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta_rad)) / g

# Simulation parameters
angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)  # Angles from 0 to 90 degrees
initial_velocities = [10, 20, 30]  # Different initial velocities

g = 9.81  # Gravity (m/s^2)

# Plot range vs. angle for different velocities
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
for v0 in initial_velocities:
    ranges = [projectile_range(v0, theta, g) for theta in angles]
    plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s')

plt.xlabel('Launch Angle (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (meters)')
plt.title('Projectile Range as a Function of Launch Angle')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

---

## **Observations**
- The maximum range occurs at **45Â°**.
- The same range is achieved for two complementary angles (e.g., 30Â° and 60Â°).
- Increasing **initial velocity** increases the range.
- Increasing **gravity** decreases the range.

### **Next Steps**
For a more realistic simulation, consider adding:
âœ… **Air resistance** (drag force)
âœ… **Uneven terrain**
âœ… **Variable gravity (e.g., Moon vs. Earth vs. Mars)**

# Problem 1: Projectile Motion Analysis

## Introduction
Projectile motion is a key concept in mechanics that explains how objects move through the air when launched. This study explores how the **range** (horizontal distance) of a projectile depends on the **angle of projection**.

## Governing Equation
The range \( R \) of a projectile launched with an initial velocity \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

where:
- \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity (m/s),
- \( \theta \) is the launch angle (degrees),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (m/sÂ²).

## **Python Implementation & Visualization**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def projectile_range(v0, theta, g=9.81):
    """
    Computes the range of a projectile given initial velocity and launch angle.
    """
    theta_rad = np.radians(theta)
    return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta_rad)) / g

# Simulation parameters
angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)  # Angles from 0 to 90 degrees
initial_velocities = [10, 20, 30]  # Different initial velocities

g = 9.81  # Gravity (m/s^2)

# Plot range vs. angle for different velocities
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
for v0 in initial_velocities:
    ranges = [projectile_range(v0, theta, g) for theta in angles]
    plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s')

plt.xlabel('Launch Angle (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (meters)')
plt.title('Projectile Range vs. Launch Angle')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

## **Key Observations**
ðŸ“Œ **Maximum Range at 45Â°**: The projectile reaches its farthest distance when launched at this angle.
ðŸ“Œ **Symmetry**: The same range is obtained for **two complementary angles** (e.g., 30Â° and 60Â°).
ðŸ“Œ **Higher Initial Velocity = Greater Range**: Increasing \( v_0 \) extends the projectile's reach.
ðŸ“Œ **Higher Gravity = Shorter Range**: If \( g \) increases (e.g., on Jupiter), the projectile doesn't travel as far.

---

## **Graphical Representation**
ðŸ“Š Below is a sample **graph** that will be generated by the Python script:

**Range vs. Launch Angle** for different velocities:

- **Blue Curve**: \( v_0 = 10 \) m/s
- **Orange Curve**: \( v_0 = 20 \) m/s
- **Green Curve**: \( v_0 = 30 \) m/s

This graph helps visualize how changing the angle and velocity affect the projectile's range.

---

## **Further Exploration**
To enhance realism, future improvements could include:
âœ… **Air Resistance**: Drag forces affect real-world motion.
âœ… **Uneven Terrain**: Launching from different heights changes the range.
âœ… **Different Gravity Environments**: Comparing projectile motion on the Moon vs. Earth vs. Mars.
