# Problem 1

# Projectile Range and Launch Angle


##  Introduction

- In this presentation, we explore **how far a projectile travels** depending on the **angle** it is launched.

- This distance is called the **range**.

- We focus on **ideal conditions** — no air resistance, starting and landing on the same level.


##  What is a Projectile?

A **projectile** is any object thrown into the air that moves under the force of **gravity only** (we ignore air resistance here).

Examples:

- A basketball shot

- A soccer pass

- A cannonball



## What is Range?

The **range** is the **total horizontal distance** the projectile travels across the ground **before hitting the ground again**.
  
$$
\text{Range} = \text{Horizontal speed} \times \text{Time of flight}
$$



## Horizontal and Vertical Motion

Projectile motion has **two parts**:

### Horizontal Motion
- Speed: $v_x = v_0 \cos \theta$

- No forces act horizontally → speed stays constant.

### Vertical Motion

- Speed: $v_y = v_0 \sin \theta$

- Gravity acts downward → object goes up and then comes down.



## Time of Flight

To calculate how long the projectile is in the air:

$$
t = \frac{2v_0 \sin \theta}{g}
$$

- More upward speed → longer flight.

- Symmetrical: same time up and down.



## Range Formula 

Start with:
$$
R = v_x \times t = v_0 \cos \theta \times \frac{2v_0 \sin \theta}{g}
$$

Now simplify:

$$
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}
$$

Final formula tells us:

- Range depends on **speed squared**,

- **Launch angle** through $\sin 2\theta$,

- And **gravity**.


##  Graph: Range vs. Launch Angle

> This graph shows how range changes depending on the launch angle:

- The **peak** is at **45°**

- Range is the **same** at **30° and 60°**

- At **0° and 90°**, the range is zero.

## Key Observations

- Maximum range at **45°**

- $\sin 2\theta$ causes **symmetry** in the graph:

  - $\theta = 30^\circ$ and $\theta = 60^\circ$ → same range

- Range increases with square of speed:

  Double the speed → 4 times the range



##  Real-World Examples

- Athletes often aim around 45° for maximum throw.

- Artillery and rockets use this physics in their targeting.

- In real life, air resistance **would reduce** the range.



## Conclusion

- **Range** depends on **initial speed**, **launch angle**, and **gravity**.

- **45°** is the ideal launch angle for max range (with no air resistance).

- The formula $R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}$ summarizes everything.
