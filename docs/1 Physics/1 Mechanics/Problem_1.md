# Problem 1: Projectile Motion Analysis

## Introduction
Projectile motion is a key concept in mechanics that explains how objects move through the air when launched. This study explores how the **range** (horizontal distance) of a projectile depends on the **angle of projection**.

## Governing Equation
The range \( R \) of a projectile launched with an initial velocity \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

where:
- **\( v_0 \)**: Initial velocity (m/s)
- **\( \theta \)**: Launch angle (degrees)
- **\( g \)**: Acceleration due to gravity (m/s²)

## **Graphical Representation**
Below is a **graph** illustrating how the projectile range varies with the launch angle for different initial velocities:

### 🔹 **Key Observations**
📌 **Maximum Range at 45°** → The projectile reaches its farthest distance when launched at this angle.  
📌 **Symmetry in Motion** → Two complementary angles (e.g., 30° and 60°) yield the same range.  
📌 **Effect of Initial Velocity** → Increasing \( v_0 \) results in a greater range.  
📌 **Effect of Gravity** → A higher gravitational force (e.g., on Jupiter) shortens the projectile's range.

## **Further Exploration**
Future studies and simulations could consider:
$$ - 🌍 **Air Resistance:** The influence of drag on real-world motion. $$
$$ - 🏔️ **Uneven Terrain:** Effects of launching from different heights. $$
$$ - 🌕 **Gravity Variations:** Comparing motion on the **Moon, Earth, and Mars**. $$
