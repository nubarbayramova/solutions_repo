In this problem, we analyze how the range of a projectile depends on the angle of projection . Governing Equation The range \\(R\\) of a projectile launched with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\u03b8\\) (with respect to the horizontal) is given by: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] where: \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity (m/s), \\(\u03b8\\) is the launch angle (degrees), \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (m/s\u00b2).
